# DNA Nucleotide Count Web App

This app counts nucleotides in a DNA sequence inputted by the user. The count breakdown is visualized with interactive charts.

## App Demo

https://christinestraub-dna-nucleotide-count-app-dna-u1gviv.streamlit.app/


## Key features:

- Input text box for DNA sequence
- Processing visualization
- Nucleotide count donut chart
- Bar plot of composition percentage


## Usage Instructions

To run the code:

1. Clone repository

`git clone https://github.com/christinestraub/DNA-Nucleotide-Count-App.git`

2. Install dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Execute Streamlit app

`streamlit run app.py

4. Enter DNA seqeunce and press Process button

## Application workflow:


1. Accept DNA sequence input
2. Validate sequence
3. Clean sequence
4. Count nucleotides (A, T, C, G)
5. Visualize counts in chart
6. Display nucleotide percentage composition
